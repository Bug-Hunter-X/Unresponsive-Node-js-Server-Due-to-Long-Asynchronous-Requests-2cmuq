# Unresponsive Node.js Server Due to Long Asynchronous Requests

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js applications where long-running asynchronous operations can block the event loop, making the server unresponsive to new requests.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` presents a solution using techniques like worker threads or promises to prevent blocking.

## Problem

Node.js uses a single-threaded event loop.  If an asynchronous operation takes a long time to complete, it can prevent other operations from executing.  This is especially problematic in server applications, where responsiveness is crucial.  The provided example simulates this by introducing a 5-second delay in the request handler.

## Solution

There are several ways to address this:

1. **Worker Threads (for CPU-bound tasks):** Offload the long-running operation to a separate worker thread, preventing it from blocking the main thread.
2. **Promises and async/await:**  Structure your asynchronous code using promises and `async/await` for better readability and easier handling of asynchronous operations.  While this doesn't directly resolve blocking, it helps you write cleaner and more manageable asynchronous code.
3. **Queueing:**  Use a task queue (like Redis or RabbitMQ) to handle long-running operations asynchronously.  This provides better scalability and resilience.
4. **Clustering:**  Employ Node.js clustering to distribute requests across multiple processes, improving throughput and resilience.

This example focuses on using Worker Threads for demonstration purposes.
